            <dd style="font-size: large;">Two major historical events compete for recognition on April 14. At 10:00 p.m. on April 14, 1865, actor John Wilkes Booth entered the presidential box at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., and fatally shot President Abraham Lincoln. At approximately 11:40 PM, April 14, 1912, the R.M.S. 
                Titanic on its maiden voyage struck an iceberg off the coast of Newfoundland and sank to the bottom of the sea at about 2:20 a.m. the next morning, taking the lives of 1,517 people.</dd>

        <p style="font-size: large;">
            The sinking of the Titanic was the first international news story of the twentieth century to receive instantaneous, intensive coverage world-wide. By 1912, the development and use of telegraphs 
            and photographs had reached a point that allowed news about the Titanic tragedy to be spread quickly and widely.
            <br>
            American newspapers had an advantage over the British press, since survivors of the Titanic were brought to New York City. American newspapers had some of their best reporters in place when the first inquiry 
            into the disaster was held by the U.S. Senate at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City, the day after the survivors landed.
